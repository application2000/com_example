# com_example
Example component using multiple context custom fields. Joomla 3.8.x minimum is required.

## Why?
This repo has been created as a proof of concept or rather a base component to work on multiple-context custom fields in custom
Joomla! components.

## What?
When you enable custom fields management in your Joomla! custom component, by default you can manage only one context or "thing"
that you can use custom fields on. This example component helps you getting started using multiple context custom fields and custom
fields groups just like com_content and do even more.

## How?
Based on the code in administrator/components/com_content/helpers/content.php, 
the two revelant static methods are getContexts() and validateSection($section)
With near to no code at all. Just a little change, you can start leveraging multiple contexts custom fields.

## Conclusion
Hope it helps. Keep Joomla! developers community growing. Don't give up! Go Joomla!
Any useful remarks or contributions are more than welcome.
Thank you for your time. Take care. Have a nice day!
